Summary: What you need to do before we have our first session

Thank you for your interest in *iOS Programming With Swift*. By now you've decided to take this class and are itching to start. Here are a few things that you should do before we meet for our first session:

## Get Your Mac Ready

Make sure you have a Mac computer that's running the latest version of the Mac OS X operating system. Currently, this is Yosemite. Please do not install the Beta version of El Capitan on it, since people have reported problems with the XCode running on El Capitan.

## Get An Apple ID

Make sure you have an Apple ID, and that you know its password. If you do not have an Apple ID, you can make one at the [Apple ID Page][]. Apple IDs can be made free of charge. 

## Install XCode

XCode is the main tool we use to write iOS apps. Please download and install XCode before you come in for the first session. It is a free program, but it is also very large (more than 4Gb) so it might take several hours to download, depending on the speed of your internet connection. In other words, don't wait for Friday night or Saturday morning to download it :). I will have it on a flash drive in class, if you just can't download it, but if you can download and install it, it will save everyone's time on Saturday morning.  If you have any difficulty installing it, please let me know. You can find XCode on the [Download Page][] 

## Bring Your Device and Cable to Class

Apple has recently started allowing users to install their apps onto their personal phones even if they do *not* have a developers license ($99/year). So please make sure you bring your iPhone or iPod or iPad and the USB charging cable that allows you to connect it to your computer. If you don't have it, it's not the end of the world - you can always run the apps you make on a simulator on your Mac.
