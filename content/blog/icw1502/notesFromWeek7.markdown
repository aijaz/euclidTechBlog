## <a name="toc2"></a>What we learned this week

This week we learned about protocols and classes. We covered conforming, casting, properties and polymorphism. Then we looked at generics and protocol extensions. Then we focused on classes, initializers, optional chaining and composition. Next week we will start working on our iOS project, inshaAllah.
